This project is kinda in bad bad need of cleaning up lol

Started out thinking i wanted to try building a Army builder type tool for table top gaming with a side project of doing a UI framework for my Werbl.js framework....

then i ended up doing a TTS speech reader software... its currently just tested under linux mint and mostly aimed for that... it depends on having a flatpack edge browser installed... though it can be run in edge or chrome though chrome is less generous with the TTS voices.. 

it only reads txt files for now since mucking about with epub formated stuff is tricky and my previous project had compatability issues... so now i am just converting with calibre to txt and from there i can feed it into this which neatly turns books into a set of pages that ware not to large for the browser TTS to read and then plays them sequentially and uses local storage to bookmark the spot every time a page is turned... there is a stupid infinite look error at the end so it will keep re-reading the copy right endlessly but not tha big of a problem...

it's entierly functional for my need at least... i just want a reliable option to listen to my j-novel and other drm free epubs... 

hopefully i can get an ubuntu mobile phone in future and get this running of that i did do a mobile type interface fix...  though if i hosted this i bet i could just run it in my mobile that way hmmm... something to do maybe...
